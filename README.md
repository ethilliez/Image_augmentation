# Image_augmentation
![Alt Text](https://raw.github.com/ethilliez/Image_augmentation/master/example/example.jpeg "Example of transformations" )

## Description:
Tool to augmentate images data by performing basic geometric transformations. The example above displays translation, rotation, contrast adjustement and image shearing.


## Personal development goals:
- Practising basic image manipulation techniques without using libraries.
- Preparing a tool to augment image dataset for future Neural Network training.

## Status:
- Mirror flipping implemented
- Translation implemented
- Rotation implemented
- Shear implemented
- Contrast adjustment implemented
- Resizing In progress

## Execution:
TO COME.
